SpacePy Help
************

The best way to get help is to `open an issue
<https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy/issues>`_. Searching existing
issues may find other people who have had similar questions. Try
changing the filters (at the top) to include closed issues, as they
may have been addressed.

Most modules also have a contact person listed in the docstring. These
are built into in the main :doc:`index`, or you can view it from
within Python/IPython::

>>> import spacepy.pycdf
>>> help(spacepy.pycdf)
>>> print(spacepy.pycdf.__contact__)

A web version of this documentation is currently hosted at
`spacepy.github.io <https://spacepy.github.io/>`_.

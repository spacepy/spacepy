The spacepy_testing module
==========================

.. module:: spacepy_testing

The ``spacepy_testing`` module contains utilities for assistance with
testing SpacePy. It is not installed as part of SpacePy and is thus
only importable from the unit test scripts themselves (which are in the
same directory.)

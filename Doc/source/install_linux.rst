******************
Linux Installation
******************

If using your system's built-in Python SpacePy we recommend installing
dependencies :ref:`via the package manager <linux_dep_apt>`. Our
recommended (but not required) standalone Python distribution is
`Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>`_ running 64-bit
Python 3. Anaconda includes much of the scientific Python stack.

SpacePy ships 64-bit binaries for most modern Linux
distributions. They are built with the `manylinux2014_x86_64
<https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/>`_ Docker images and should work
on any x86_64 Linux using glibc2.17 or later, e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 and
CentOS 7.

Building from source on Linux requires both a C and a Fortran
compiler; a recent GCC is recommended (the C compiler is likely
included with your distribution). On Debian and Ubuntu::
  
      sudo apt-get install gfortran

Once this is set up, ``pip install spacepy`` should Just Work. If
you're installing as a single user (not in a virtual environment) then
add the ``--user`` flag.

You will also need the :ref:`NASA CDF library <linux_CDF>` to use
:mod:`~spacepy.pycdf`.

If you prefer to install the dependencies some way other than pip, see
:ref:`linux_dep_conda` and :ref:`linux_dep_apt`.

Dependencies via conda
======================

Installation via ``pip`` will automatically install most Python
dependencies (but not the :ref:`NASA CDF library <linux_CDF>`). They
can also be installed from conda::

  conda install numpy python-dateutil scipy matplotlib h5py

.. _linux_dep_apt:

Dependencies via system packages
================================

SpacePy usually works with the system Python on Linux. To install dependencies via the package manager on Debian or Ubuntu::

  sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-h5py python3-matplotlib python3-numpy python3-dateutil python3-scipy

For other distributions, check :doc:`dependencies` and install by hand
or via your package manager. 

To get the dependencies for building documentation::

  sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx python3-numpydoc

.. _linux_CDF:

CDF
===
The NASA CDF library is included if installing from a binary wheel. If
you build SpacePy from source or wish to use a different version of the
CDF library, you will need to install it.

It is recommended to install the ncurses library; on Ubuntu and Debian::

    sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev

Download the latest `CDF library <http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_. Choose
the file ending in ``-dist-all.tar.gz`` from the ``linux``
directory. Untar and cd into the resulting directory. Then build::

    make OS=linux ENV=gnu CURSES=yes FORTRAN=no UCOPTIONS=-O2 SHARED=yes all

Use ``CURSES=no`` if the curses library is not installed. (The
distribution-specific directions above will install curses.)

Install::

    sudo make install

This will install the library into the default location ``/usr/local/cdf``, where 
SpacePy can find it. If you choose to install elsewhere, see the CDF documentation, 
particularly the notes on the ``CDF_BASE`` and ``CDF_LIB`` environment variables. 
SpacePy uses these variables to find the library.

Raspberry Pi
============
SpacePy works on Raspberry Pi, using Raspberry Pi OS in 32-bit or
64-bit flavors. A few tips:

   * No binary wheels are provided, so you will need to build from source.

   * It is highly recommended to install all dependencies (numpy,
     etc.) via the system package manager ``apt-get`` rather than
     pip, as prebuilt wheels are not generally available and compiling
     dependencies on the Pi can take a very long time::

      sudo apt-get install gfortran python3-numpy python3-dateutil python3-scipy python3-h5py python3-matplotlib

   * Similarly, use the ``--no-build-isolation`` flag to use the system numpy.

Building spacepy for distribution (20201226)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.

Prepare the release commit
--------------------------

Note: it's probably best to get the latest up on test PyPI first to
make sure it works! Also best to go through this process for a release
candidate to test PyPI https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#pre-releases.

Edit the release notes to include the release date.

The following changes should result in either the final release version,
or the appropriate release candidate (i.e. add "rc1" if building rc).
Edit Doc/source/conf.py. Around line 128, remove (DRAFT) from the title.
    Change version around line 72 (two places!)
Change version in setup.py, in setup_kwargs near bottom.
Change __version__ around line 209 of __init__.py.

Commit these changes. Submit PR. (Tagging is done on github now.)

Miniconda setup
---------------
Download/install the latest miniconda into some appropriate place
on the machine where you'll do the source build, e.g.:
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/miniconda

(See also developer/scripts/test_all.sh for some details).

If CDF library isn't installed, download/install CDF, so that the pycdf
library will import and the docs build:
wget https://spdf.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/cdf38_0/linux/cdf38_0-dist-cdf.tar.gz; tar xzf cdf38_0-dist-cdf.tar.gz; pushd cdf38_0-dist; make OS=linux ENV=gnu all; make INSTALLDIR=$HOME/cdf install; popd
source ${HOME}/cdf/bin/definitions.B

Make a clean isolated environment just for SpacePy build:
~/miniconda/bin/conda create -y -n spacepy_build python=3
source ~/miniconda/bin/activate spacepy_build
conda install numpy
conda install scipy matplotlib networkx h5py astropy sphinx numpydoc
pip install ffnet

(Use "conda deactivate" when done, but not done yet...))

Prepare the source build
------------------------

On a Unix machine:
Activate the conda environment, if necessary.

check out the latest from git (hopefully the release commit!)

Clear out old builds:
    rm -rf build/ Doc/build/ Doc/source/autosummary/

Be sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and similar aren't set so that the conda
environment isn't pulling in anything from the host environment.

Build and install so getting the latest inputs for the autodocs:
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= python setup.py build
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= python setup.py install
(No --user because it's being installed in the conda env.)

Build the docs:
    cd Doc
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= make html
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= make latexpdf
Newer sphinx uses latexmk (apt-get install latexmk) not pdflatex...

Then:
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will build the docs, but no longer needs
to do a binary build.

Prepare the Windows binaries
----------------------------

Unzip the source distribution from the Unix side. Get the Windows
build scripts from the repository. They're in developer/scripts but
are not included in the source distribution. They need to be put in
developer/scripts in the unzipped source so they can find the rest of
SpacePy. Yes this could be improved.

Download latest (currently 3.7) 64-bit Miniconda from
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html and put it in the
system-default download directory (%USERPROFILE%\Downloads)

Set up conda environments for the build by running
"win_build_system_setup.cmd build". This will make conda environments
and install the earliest supported version of numpy in each. Then run
build_win.cmd to make Windows binaries and wheels, and
win_build_system_teardown.cmd to remove those environment (and
miniconda). Windows binaries and wheels will be in the "dist"
directory of the SpacePy distribution.

There may be a console error "This application has requested the
Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way" with a popup "python.exe
has stopped working." This doesn't seem to be a problem, just click
"Close the program" in the popup.

Making Linux and Mac binaries
-----------------------------
Skip this for now, will need investigation into Mac portability across
OS versions, as well as Linux cross-distro compatibility. See
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/.

Assumes miniconda is in ~/miniconda.

Unzip the source distribution made above into another directory. Copy
over the developer/scripts/unix_wheels.sh script into that directory
(top-level is fine, next to setup.py) Run:
    bash ./unix_wheels.sh

The binary wheels will be in the "dist" directory.

Fixing wheel metadata version
-----------------------------

The wheels are compliant with metadata 2.0 but are labeled as 2.1, which makes for problems unless everybody has the very newest version of everything. For now, we should edit them. This should be done on ALL the wheels (so ideally collect together the wheels built on different systems into a single dist directory).

for i in *.whl; do unzip $i "spacepy-*.dist-info/METADATA"; sed -i -e "s/Metadata-Version: 2.1/Metadata-Version: 2.0/" spacepy-*.dist-info/METADATA; zip $i "spacepy-*.dist-info/METADATA"; rm -rf spacepy-*.dist-info; done

General notes on binaries:

It looks like the wheels are compatible across Windows versions,
i.e. a wheel built on Windows 10 seems to install okay in Windows 7,
which is great.

Using the oldest supported numpy for the build is used for ABI
compatibility for the f2py-built extensions (irbem mostly). See
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5888. It looks like there isn't
a way to specify the ABI version in f2py so the only answer is to
compile with an old-enough numpy. In particular there's a note "SciPy
pins its build system to the oldest numpy it wishes to support".

ABI is in numpy/core/setup_common.py and there's no history, so going
through the git tags for each numpy release gives:

1.4 through current master : 0x01000009

It looks like ABI version is a complete break: if it changes, old
modules will no longer work. However, the API version is backward
compatible: any version with a particular API version can be used on
anything with the same API version (even older numpy versions) or
newer, provided ABI version is the same. There's a list in
numpyconfig.h but it disagrees with the history given in
setup_common.py; they are probably used for slightly different
purposes. History going through commits of setup_common.py is:

1.10.0, 1.11.0, 1.12.0: 0x0000000a
1.13.0: 0x0000000b
1.14.0, 1.15.0: 0x0000000c
1.16.0, 1.17.0, 1.18.0, 1.19.0: 0x0000000d
1.20.0: 0x0000000e

The list in the latest setup_common.py is incomplete (it seems to
imply that gaps are filled with the same value.)


Docs
----

From the Doc directory:
cp build/latex/SpacePy.pdf spacepy-x.y.z-doc.pdf
cd build/html
zip -r ../../spacepy-0.2.1-doc.zip *

Test PyPI
---------

https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/

Consider https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#pre-releases

Make a .pypirc file, see https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html

[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username: <username>

[testpypi]
repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username: <username>

(end of .pypirc)

Put all the builds (wheels, source dists, not the docs) into one
directory. Use the spacepy_build conda environment and install twine:

  source ~/miniconda/bin/activate spacepy_build
  conda install twine

and then do the upload:

  PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH= twine upload -r testpypi spacepy-*.zip spacepy-*.whl

PyPI does not support Windows standalone installers, and can only take
one source distribution (zip or tar.gz, so we use zip.)

Test installing with:

  pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ spacepy

Do this on Windows without compilers installed, and in a clean Linux
Anaconda env. You can use the --pre flag to install the RC version; in
that case, probably want to use --no-deps so don't get RC version of
dependencies! (Or can specify the rc version, e.g. spacepy==0.2.2rc1).

Release to PyPI
---------------

https://python-packaging-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uploading_pypi.html

  twine upload spacepy-*.zip spacepy-*.whl

Do not upload the .tar.gz since can only upload one source package per release.

There's no longer any capability to edit information on PyPI, it's
straight from the setup.py metadata. This may cause problems with the
fact that we're CamelCase on PyPI...

Release to github
-----------------

https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases

On the code tab, click on "n releases" (on the right column, below
"about"). Click "Draft a new release." Make the tag
"release-x.y.z" and hopefully the target will be master if it's up to
date. The most consistent with what we've done so far (which is not
necessarily the best) is to use just "x.y.z" as the title with nothing
the "describe."

Click in the "upload binaries" area and upload all the files: source
distribution, Windows installers, wheels. Also upload the
documentation PDF (spacepy-x.y.z-doc.pdf) and a zip
(spacepy-x.y.z-doc.zip).

Documentation update
--------------------

Check out the spacepy.github.io repository. Right now the root of the
repo is basically the root of the Doc/build/html output. Copy all the
freshly-built docs there, commit, submit PR.

Relevant notes
--------------

Reference that have been useful for putting the wheels together (this
can eventually be captured elsewhere.)

Wheel is a separate package but seems to be included with
miniconda. (It's not just pip or setuptools, but it might be a
requirement for pip? Although not installed on Linux with pip.)

datamodel
 - Fix in SpaceData.toXXX() methods which would fail in some cases, now work as intended
 - Documentation update and default units change in createISTPattrs
datamanager
 - New function "rebin", rebin an axis of an array by contents of another
irbempy
 - Update IRBEMlib to rev620
 - Rev620 adds IGRF13 coefficients
 - Add conversion so all systems supported by coordinates can be passed
   to IRBEMlib routines
 - Fix compilation on Raspberry Pi
plot
 - utils.EventClicker support for non-line plots (e.g. pcolor)
 - New method for adding arrows to lines in utils
pycdf
 - VarCopy objects now carry information to help reproduce original

   another variable
 - istp.VariableChecks adds check for VALID/SCALE MIN/MAX Entry types

 - istp.VarBundle class to copy variables, slices, and depends between CDFs
 - istp.nanfill function to replace fill values with NaN
 - Warn if make CDF without explicitly setting backward compatible mode
   (either true or false); default will change to NOT backward compatible.
 - Warn if assign datetime to a variable without specifying a type;
   default will change to CDF_TIME_TT2000.
 - Fix epoch_to_num with newer versions of matplotlib.
pybats
 - Updated gitm.GitmBin reader to fix failures in Python 3.x.
 - Fix for incorrect Kyoto Kp plots.
 - Fixed open/closed tolerance kwarg not working in add_b_magsphere.
 - Added new stream trace visualization method for Bats2d objects: add_stream_scatter
 - Bats2d.add_b_magsphere and add_stream_scatter now have kwargs for adding arrows on ray traces
 - Updates to ram.RamSat including omnidirectional flux calculation
 - ram.PressureFile fixed for Python 3.x failures
 - rim.Iono objects now load poorly-formatted files; rim.fix_format deprecated
time
 - Fix handling of leapseconds before 1961.
 - For types that cannot represent leapseconds (e.g. UTC datetime), time
   within the leap second is now converted to the end of the day rather
   than the beginning of the next day.
 - Fractional leapsecond counts are now rounded to the integer rather than
   truncated.
 - Fix conversions to ISO before 1900 on Python 2.
 - Include leapseconds in JD/MJD calculation, so the length of a second on a
   day with leapseconds is slightly shorter but leap second times are not lost.
 - Most time systems are now converted to/from TAI. This may cause small
   differences with previous versions of SpacePy, on order of a double
   precision. Time conversions around leapseconds may also be different;
   in many cases they were undefined in previous versions.
 - now and today return UTC times, not local.
 - matplotlib no longer required, including RDT and randomDate.

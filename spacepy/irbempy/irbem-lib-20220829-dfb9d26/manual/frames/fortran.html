        Make sure anyway that the variables are of the same type as defined in the detailled

    <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="4">To link any FORTRAN source code with the&nbsp;static library
        you&nbsp;have to add at the end of the compilation&nbsp;command the option -Lpath
        where path&nbsp;allows to locate the static library file and the option -loneradesp
        (make sure the static lib name is liboneradesp.a)<BR>
        <br>
        If you have been using the Makefile to build the library then you have to add the proper 
        option depending on the compiler in order to force the compiler to add only a single underscore
        to any subroutine. e.g. with g77 the option is -fno-second-underscore.</font>
